If we consider that part of the theory of relativity which may 2 
nowadays in a sense be regarded as bona fide scientific knowledge, 
we 3 note two aspects which have a major bearing on this theory. 
The whole 4 development of the theory turns on the question of 
whether there are s physically preferred states of motion in 
Nature (physical relativity 6 problem). Also, concepts and 
distinctions are only admissible to the 7 extent that observable
facts can be assigned to them without s ambiguity (stipulation
that concepts and distinctions should have 9 meaning). This
postulate, pertaining to epistemology, proves to be of 
10fundamental importance.
