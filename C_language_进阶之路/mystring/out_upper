IF WE CONSIDER THAT PART OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY WHICH MAY 2 
NOWADAYS IN A SENSE BE REGARDED AS BONA FIDE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, 
WE 3 NOTE TWO ASPECTS WHICH HAVE A MAJOR BEARING ON THIS THEORY. 
THE WHOLE 4 DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY TURNS ON THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER THERE ARE S PHYSICALLY PREFERRED STATES OF MOTION IN 
NATURE (PHYSICAL RELATIVITY 6 PROBLEM). ALSO, CONCEPTS AND 
DISTINCTIONS ARE ONLY ADMISSIBLE TO THE 7 EXTENT THAT OBSERVABLE
FACTS CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THEM WITHOUT S AMBIGUITY (STIPULATION
THAT CONCEPTS AND DISTINCTIONS SHOULD HAVE 9 MEANING). THIS
POSTULATE, PERTAINING TO EPISTEMOLOGY, PROVES TO BE OF 
10FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.
